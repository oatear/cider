# Privacy Policy for Oatear Cider

**Effective Date:** August 2, 2025

Oatear LLC ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Oatear Cider application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Our core principle is simple: your data is your own. This policy outlines our steadfast commitment to not collecting your personal information.

## 1. The Core Principle: No Data Collection

We want to be crystal clear: **Oatear Cider does not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information.**

The App is designed to work entirely offline on your device. We do not include any third-party analytics, advertising frameworks, or tracking tools.

Specifically, we **DO NOT** collect:
-   **Personal Identifiable Information (PII):** Your name, email address, physical address, phone number, or any other contact information. The App does not have user accounts.
-   **User-Generated Content:** Your projects, card designs, templates, tabular data, and generated assets are your intellectual property. This content is stored exclusively on your local device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.
-   **Usage Data & Analytics:** The App does not collect information about how you use it, such as session frequency, features used, or crash reports that are sent to us.
-   **Device Information:** We do not collect information about your device, such as its unique device ID, IP address, operating system version, or hardware model.

## 2. How Your Data is Used and Stored

All data you create within Oatear Cider remains under your control and on your device. The storage method depends on the version of the App you are using:

-   **Desktop Application (macOS, Windows, Linux):** Your project is saved as a collection of local files (e.g., `.html`, `.css`, `.csv`, image files) in a directory you control on your computer's file system. These files are never accessed or transmitted by us.

-   **Web Application:** Your project data is stored in the browser's sandboxed **IndexedDB**. This data is local to your browser profile and is not accessible by our website or any other website. You have the option to manually export this data as a `.json` file for backup or transfer.

At no point does Oatear LLC have access to the content you create or the data you store.

## 3. Data Sharing and Third Parties

Since we do not collect any of your information, we have nothing to share. We do not sell, trade, or rent your data to any third party because we never have access to it in the first place.

## 4. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe a child has used the app and you have concerns, please contact us, but be aware that we hold no user data to investigate or delete.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
